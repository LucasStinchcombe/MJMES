It is intended to demonstrate the dynamic variety and depth of scholarship present within the McGill student community. Staff and contributors come from both graduate and and undergraduate programs in Middle East Studies, Islamic Studies, Political Science, Economics, Anthropology, History, Jewish Studies, and other disciplines. In each issue, we attempt to showcase interdisciplinary approaches to matters pertinent to the region.\r\n\r\nThe MJMES is an annual academic journal publishing original research and insight on the Modern Middle East. The works published are authored by undergraduate and graduate students from McGill University and around the world. The Journal is now publishing shorter analytical essays related to the modern Middle East in this blog space. While still academically oriented, the articles will be more informal and timely and tied to current events.\r\n", "images": [1]}, "model": "about.aboutus", "pk": 1}]
