However, the purpose of this paper is to focus on the ways in which domestic factors in both countries contributed to the conflict. As tensions between the two states increased, Morocco and Algeria were experiencing severe internal unrest. Thus, the ruling elite had a particular interest in engaging in an external conflict to detract attention from domestic repression and creeping authoritarianism following the colonial era.This paper uses \u201cdiversionary theory\u201d to argue that \u201cleaders threatened by domestic turmoil manipulate the \u2018rally around the flag\u2019 effect by initiating conflict abroad \u2026 mitigat[ing] the negative effects of the unrest, thus saving the leader\u2019s position.\u201d[2] The aim of this analysis is not to show that the Sand War was triggered solely to divert the attention of Moroccans and Algerians away from internal unrest, but rather to examine how domestic upheaval and diversionary logic were one of many factors underlying the conflict.\r\n\r\nMorocco\u2019s Internal Politics in the Early 1960s and its Impact on Hassan II\u2019s Policy-Making Process\r\n------------------\r\nAfter his ascension to the throne in 1961, King Hassan II of Morocco initiated a shift in his country\u2019s foreign policy. In parallel with the long and tedious process of decolonization, he attempted to restore political stability through the use of domestic force. Nonetheless, this attempt proved to be rather unsuccessful and was met with broad popular discontent.\r\n\r\nThe political cleavages inherited from the French protectorate played a key role in Morocco\u2019s internal politics during the early 1960s. The Istiqlal party, the principal ally of the monarchy in its struggle against colonialism, soon became the state\u2019s main opponent after independence (1956). Indeed, Istiqlal\u2019s political figures strongly criticized Hassan II\u2019s lack of legitimacy in comparison to his father\u2019s reign, as well as his lack of effort to recover the territories Morocco lost during the colonial era. Moreover, Hassan II was thought to be a feudal figure that used corruption and a venal bureaucracy to assert his power.  The opposition was mobilized through two different channels : the conservative nationalists  and the Union National des Forces Populaires (UNFP), a Marxist party which split from Istiqlal in 1959 over ideological differences.\r\n\r\nThe situation worsened with the significant decline in standard of living and increased repression. In 1962, Hassan II put in place the first constitution and initiated superficial reforms in an attempt to democratize the country and boost his popularity. In 1963, legislative and municipal elections were expected, making it a critical year for the building of the country\u2019s political stability. To counter growing opposition,  the King created a political party in 1963, the FDIC (Front de D\u00e9fense des Institutions Constitutionnelles) and exerted control over another, known as the MP Party (Mouvement Populaire). Despite the  relatively wide support  that the FDIC gained, the UNFP and the Istiqlal parties were still able to mobilize 56,5% of the electorate.[3] The FDIC\u2019s electoral defeat precipitated a political war waged by Hassan II against the opposition, resulting in a series of arrests against political leaders and the shut down of opposition media sources. On July 16, 1963 the state arrested approximately 5000 UNFP and communist activists and the courts sentenced some figures, such as Fqih Basri, to death. Other opposition members, such as Ben Barka, fled to Algeria and created the \u201cforeign provisory directorate of the UNFP.\u201d\r\n\r\nBarka\u2019s decision to seek asylum in Algeria is highly significant given the political environment at the time After a hundred years of devastating colonial rule, Algeria experienced an eight year war for independence that led to severe social and economic problems. Nevertheless, the Moroccan opposition figures, such as Ben Barka and Bouabid, openly encouraged the establishment of a socialist regime in Algeria and sympathized with the revolution. As a consequence of their support,  Moroccan exiles were welcomed in Algeria with open arms. This situation fed Hassan II\u2019s suspicions and fears with regards to the prospective establishment of another socialist republic in North Africa.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Hassan II also had to face nationalist claims against his rule. In his quest for legitimacy, the king started diplomatic talks with neighboring Spain over the Sahara region and reached a compromise : Morocco would regain its sovereignty over the territories while Spain would gain economic access to the country\u2019s resources. The deal was never implemented since Franco eventually rejected any negotiation on the status of Spanish Sahara. Shortly after, in March 1963, Hassan II travelled to Algiers to initiate talks on the common land border that the French had left undefined. The king wanted to negotiate a new frontier that would include Morocco\u2019s territorial claims over Tindouf. The Algerian prime minister at the time, Ahmed Ben Bella, suggested that the issue should be discussed at a later date \u2013 as soon as Algeria\u2019s political institutions were established and its stability guaranteed. These successive foreign policy failures heavily threatened the monarchy and put the regime under growing internal pressure.  Political unrest added to Hassan II\u2019s failed attempts to meet the opposition\u2019s demands  strongly influenced the course of events, and more precisely the launching of the Sand War.\r\n\r\nThe Dire Algerian Internal Situation : from Insurrection to Civil War.\r\n------------------\r\nAt the same time as King  Hassan II was battling popular discontent in Morocco, Algeria\u2019s new government was experiencing an equally, if not more, dire domestic conflict.  The French occupation left the country divided into multiple military districts, or wilayas, that became almost independent and autarchic.  The French colonialists destroyed or dismantled most of Algeria\u2019s productive sectors during their retreat, depriving the country of most of its civil servants, doctors, teachers and skilled workers. This resulted in a catastrophic economic situation which, coupled with a global atmosphere of chaos, created a decentralized state with no firm locus of power.\r\n\r\nIn parallel with this difficult social and economic situation, the political scene in Algeria was marked by a lack of coherence and unity. The FLN (National Liberation Front) which supposedly represented the bloc of anti-colonial forces experienced several internal crises and left a political vacuum that was soon filled by the GPRA (Algerian Provisional Revolutionary Government) and the ALN (National Liberation Army). Both parties operated outside the country, and the GPRA acted as a government-in-exile. This fragmentation led to a struggle for dominance over the state. Ahmed Ben Bella, a prominent FLN figure, eventually consolidated power in 1962 after he suppressed his political opponents and gained the support of the army. On 20 September 1962, Ben Bella was elected and, within a few months, Algeria was recognized as a member of the United Nations. During his first year as president, he concentrated power in his own hands by forging an alliance between the army and the civil government. Additionally, Ben Bella established a one-party government, outlawed his opponents, abolished the wilaya system and took on the role of Prime Minister, President of the Republic, Secretary General of the FLN and Commander-in-Chief of the army. Opposition parties launched an armed confrontation against the regime from 1962 to 1964 in response to the president\u2019s centralization of power. The Kabyle region proved to be particularly rebellious and defied Ben Bella\u2019s authority, accusing him of creating a fascist dictatorship. The Algerian leader used force to crush the different insurrections, and in October 1963, government troops \u201cpeacefully occupied the Kabyle capital of Tizi-Ouzou\u201d.[4]Simultaneously, several demonstrations organized by the unemployed took place in Oran and Constantine, followed by urban terrorism and assassination attempts.\r\n\r\nHassan II took advantage of Algeria\u2019s political instability to impose his will. A few days after the beginning of the insurrection in the Kabyle region, Moroccan troops took control of two key frontier posts : Hassi-Beida and Tindjoub. The Sand War broke out in 29 October, and was \u201cthe first open-armed conflict between both countries and it represent[ed] an early illustrative case of the troublesome nature of Algerian\u2013Moroccan relations during the post-independence period that has stubbornly undermined the project of Maghribi integration\u201d.[5]\r\n\r\nThe Sand war quickly escalated into a full-blown confrontation and saw intense fighting around the Algerian town of Bechar and the Moroccan town of Figuig. Given the superiority of the modernized and well-equipped Moroccan army, Algeria appeared strongly disadvantaged. Despite its military losses, the Algerian government was able to win the political struggle over the regions of Bechar and Tindouf. Soon after the conflict reached a stalemate, international interventions (mainly by the United States, the Arab League and the Union of African Unity) managed to arrange a formal cease fire on 20 February 1964 and to reach a peace agreement. The Sand War may have ended, but its socio-psychological legacy has been strong enough to initiate a long and difficult period of tension between the two countries, aborting all attempts to foster regional harmony. These hostilities later evolved with the Western Sahara issue and, to this day, the Algerian-Moroccan borders remain closed and the countries\u2019 bilateral relations are dominated by mistrust and constant defiance. Contemporary developments of Algerian-Moroccan relations, such as last month\u2019s border confrontations, as well as spiteful and vindictive speeches, clearly show that tensions between the two countries have yet to be resolved. That being said, there is nothing imminent or inevitable about this conflict; Morocco and Algeria have a great deal of similarities in terms of language, culture, history and interests for the future. Nor are these similarities limited to the contemporary situation; indeed, the countries\u2019 socio-political conditions and the grievances brought forth by the people, which the governments sought to cover up by launching the Sand War, were more alike than different.", "subtitle": "An Overview of an Instrumentalized Conflict", "author": 1, "image": 1, "title": "The Sand War (1963)", "modified": "2015-03-04", "publish": true, "created": "2015-03-04", "tags": [1]}, "model": "blog.entry", "pk": "sand-war-1963"}, {"fields": {"author": "MJMES", "title": "Volume 14", "created": "2015-03-04", "modified": "2015-03-04", "publish": true, "pdf": "static/pdf/volume_14.pdf"}, "model": "archives.archive", "pk": "volume-14"}, {"fields": {"content": "The McGill Journal of Middle East Studies is published by the (undergraduate) Middle East Studies Students' Association (MESSA) every year.
